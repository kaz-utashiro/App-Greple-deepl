Open Data Basic Guidelines

May 30, 2017

Advanced Information and Communication Network Society Promotion Headquarters

Government-Private Data Utilization Promotion Strategy Conference Decision

Revised on June 7, 2019

Revised on June 15, 2021

In our country, awareness of the public release and utilization of data held by the government, local governments, and businesses has increased since the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. [^2]

Based on the recognition that public data is a shared asset of the people, the government has been promoting open data initiatives in accordance with the "e-Government Open Data Strategy" (Decision of the Advanced Information and Communication Network Society Promotion Headquarters on July 4, 2012) and others.

The directions for the development of new open data were indicated in "Towards the Expansion of New Open Data" (Decision of the Advanced Information and Communication Network Society Promotion Headquarters on June 30, 2015) and "Open Data 2.0" (Decision of the Advanced Information and Communication Network Society Promotion Headquarters on May 20, 2016), shifting the focus from initiatives centered on data release to "problem-solving-oriented promotion of open data" based on the assumption of data utilization.

The "Government-Private Data Utilization Promotion Basic Law" (hereinafter referred to as the "Government-Private Data Law"), which was promulgated and enforced on December 14, 2016, aims to contribute to the realization of a society where people can live safely and securely and have a comfortable living environment through the promotion of government-private data utilization, and it provides provisions regarding the easy use of government-private data held by the country, local governments, and businesses.

This document summarizes the basic guidelines for the future efforts of the country, local governments, and businesses in the public release and utilization of public data, based on the previous initiatives and the concept of Open Data by Design. [^3]

1. Significance of Open Data

The significance and objectives of promoting the public release and utilization of public data in a form that can be reused are as follows:

(1) Resolution of various issues through citizen participation and government-private collaboration, and economic revitalization

By promoting the utilization of public data by a wide range of entities, it becomes possible to provide a variety of services quickly and efficiently, utilizing creative ideas, and to realize the provision and improvement of public services through government-private collaboration. This can contribute to the resolution of various issues faced by our country, such as the diversification of needs and values, appropriate responses to environmental changes such as technological innovations, as well as the challenging fiscal situation and the rapid aging of the population.

In addition, it can stimulate the creation of diverse new services and businesses by venture companies and others, as well as the efficiency of corporate activities, leading to the overall revitalization of our country's economy.

(2) Enhancement and Efficiency of Administration

By utilizing data, information obtained can be used as a basis for planning and formulation of policies and measures (EBPM: Evidence Based Policy Making), leading to effective and efficient administration.

(3) Improvement of Transparency and Trust

By making public the public data used in policy formulation, citizens are able to conduct sufficient analysis and judgment regarding policies, increasing transparency in administration and trust from the public.

2. Definition of Open Data

Open data is defined as data that is publicly available in a form that meets any of the following criteria, allowing anyone to easily access (process, edit, redistribute, etc.) it through the internet or other means, among the government, local public bodies, and businesses:

- Data that can be reused for both profit and non-profit purposes

- Data that is suitable for machine reading

- Data that can be used free of charge

3. Basic Rules Regarding Open Data

(1) Principle of Open Data Publication for Government-held Data

Recognizing that public data is a shared asset of the nation, all data held by each ministry and agency, including data that serves as the basis for planning and formulation of policies (including laws and budgets), should be published as open data, as a principle.

However, if there are requests for the publication of information that includes personal information, may pose a risk to national security or public order, or may harm the rights and interests of corporations or individuals, the reasons for not being able to publish as open data should be disclosed, as a principle.

(2) Rules Regarding Secondary Use of Public Data

Regarding data published on the websites of each ministry and agency, the government standard terms of use should be applied as a principle, and unless there are specific and reasonable grounds for not allowing secondary use, the secondary use of public data should be actively promoted.

(3) Publication Environment

Each government ministry and agency will make data available in a searchable and easily accessible format on their websites. In particular, useful data such as "data that can only be provided by each government ministry and agency," "reliable data that can serve as basic reference material in various fields [^12]," or "real-time data [^13]" is assumed to have high social demand, so active disclosure will be pursued. In addition, from the perspective of user convenience, system load, and efficiency, the introduction of a mechanism that allows bulk downloads and promotion of data provision through APIs will be encouraged.

Furthermore, in order to enable cross-sectional search of the entire government's open data and promote the utilization of data, the metadata [^14] such as the overview and format of the data will be treated as "CC0 1.0 Universal" [^15] defined by Creative Commons, and registered and disclosed on the government's data catalog site "DATA.GO.JP."

(4) Format of disclosed data

As a principle, the data to be disclosed will be presented in a structure and data format suitable for machine readability [^16]. Referring to the "Five Stars" [^18] indicators commonly used as a benchmark for common vocabulary infrastructure and the achievement level of open data, efforts will be made to disclose in terms and formats that are easier to use.

In addition, from the perspective of information disclosure to the public, data formats suitable for traditional usage where people read the data will continue to be disclosed, but it is necessary for text search and extraction to be possible even in such cases.

In particular, data that is easily structured [^19] is primarily disclosed in a data format that is easier to use, such as "Three Stars [^20] (formats such as CSV [^21] or XML)." Furthermore, for all disclosed data that includes data that is difficult to structure, efforts will be made to improve the environment for visualization and API usage, such as the use of data catalog sites and the disclosure of metadata.

The Cabinet Secretariat's IT Strategy Office will continue to promote standardization of data structures and formats in collaboration with relevant government ministries and agencies. In addition, for data including corporate information, the corporate number will be appended.

(5) Limited disclosure of undisclosed data

2. As indicated in 2., it is a principle that all data held by each government agency should be released as open data. However, there may be information that is difficult to immediately release as open data for various reasons. In cases where there is a risk of impeding the maintenance of public safety in citizens' lives by releasing data that is currently not public as open data, it is necessary to conduct a comparative examination of the effectiveness and risks before the release. From the perspective of gradually promoting the open dataization of such data, it is effective to limit the purpose, scope, and recipients of data and release it, and promote its utilization (referred to as "limited release" below). Government agencies that conduct limited release shall also disclose their reasons and considerations (such as plans showing how data will be utilized among stakeholders under limited release).

This examination should be conducted in a closed environment, such as within trusted stakeholders, with necessary conditions such as specifying the purpose of use of the data. Limited release is desirable to be conducted with a view to future open dataization, but if there are problems with open dataization as a result of the examination, the reasons should be disclosed as a principle.

(6) Principles regarding the release of paid data

As stated in 2., if the cost of maintaining and managing the data provision system is covered by fees collected from limited users, it cannot be considered open data. However, it is desirable to apply rules that allow secondary use, following the same treatment. Additionally, regarding the fees, the following points should be reviewed, clearly indicating the basis for calculating the expenses related to the provision and the timing of certain examinations, except for cases where specific and rational grounds do not allow secondary use:

- Consideration of cost reduction related to the provision by utilizing inexpensive and safe state-of-the-art technology

- Examination of measures to increase users and reduce the burden on individual users

- Re-examination of whether it is socially and economically appropriate to provide it at the user's expense

(7) Updating of publicly released data

For data that is important to be promptly released and maintained in terms of freshness, it should be released as quickly as possible and updated in a timely and appropriate manner. Additionally, the cycle of data updates should be specified to allow users to anticipate the timing of updates.

4. Mechanisms to promote the release and utilization of open data

(1) Promotion of Open Data by Design

Each government ministry and agency will take necessary measures from the planning and design stage of administrative procedures and information systems to ensure that administrative data is released in a user-friendly format based on the concept of Open Data by Design. The Cabinet Secretariat's IT Strategy Office will provide necessary advice on the efforts of each government ministry and agency under the government's Chief Information Officer (CIO).

(2) Reflecting User Needs

It is important to proceed with the promotion of Open Data while accurately reflecting user needs. To achieve this, each government ministry and agency will publish a list that organizes the data they possess and its current status of disclosure, including potential data, in order to understand user needs and work towards the disclosure of data in a manner that meets those needs.

5. Promotion Structure

(1) Establishment of Consultation Points

To actively collect and understand the needs and opinions of users regarding Open Data and reflect them in the government's unified efforts, the Cabinet Secretariat's IT Strategy Office will establish a comprehensive consultation point for Open Data. Additionally, each government ministry and agency will also establish consultation points to actively respond to individual inquiries from users regarding Open Data.

(2) Promotion Structure

The Cabinet Secretariat's IT Strategy Office, under the government's CIO, will collaborate with each government ministry and agency to plan and coordinate the overall Open Data initiatives of the government. This includes reviewing the disclosure status of Open Data initiatives by each government ministry and agency and conducting follow-ups, in order to promote unified efforts towards Open Data. Furthermore, the Cabinet Secretariat's IT Strategy Office will cooperate with relevant government ministries and agencies to promote initiatives in local public bodies.

Each government ministry's Chief Information Officer (CIO) will promote Open Data initiatives within their respective ministry and also encourage independent administrative agencies and public service providers to engage in Open Data initiatives. Additionally, each government ministry's Deputy Chief Information Officer (Deputy CIO) and other officials responsible for information technology will assist the CIO and oversee the command and supervision of Open Data policies within the ministry.

6. Initiatives for Open Data in Local Public Bodies, Independent Administrative Agencies, and Businesses

(1) Local Public Bodies

Under Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the Public and Private Data Act, local public bodies are required to take necessary measures to make their data easily accessible to the public, similar to the national government.

Local public bodies are expected to promote Open Data in accordance with the purpose of the Public and Private Data Act and this basic guideline.

When promoting open data, it is desirable to strive for publication based on standard formats and rules, so that national and local governments can utilize data across different sectors. It is also effective for multiple organizations to collaborate and establish open data portal sites.

The government actively supports the efforts of local governments in open data through the dispatch of experts in open data, providing information on areas and data items that are particularly desired to be disclosed, offering advanced case studies and guidelines, and providing tools for talent development.

(2) Businesses

Under Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Public and Private Data Act, businesses (including independent administrative agencies) are required to take necessary measures to make data that contributes to the promotion of public interest easily accessible to the public.

Considering that independent administrative agencies and universities are operated or conducting projects and research funded by the government, it is desirable for them to promote open data in accordance with this basic guideline.

In addition, for businesses in the public utility sectors such as electricity, gas, telecommunications, broadcasting, and transportation, it is desirable to promote open data based on this basic guideline and user needs, taking into account their public interest.

7. Review of this Basic Guideline

This basic guideline will be flexibly reviewed in response to changes in technological trends, international environment, and taking into account the results of various measures and opinions and requests from the public and businesses.

[2]: In relation to the provision of disaster-related information, cooperation requests were made for providing information in easily processable file formats, and information on road traffic held by businesses was also disclosed and utilized.

[3]: It refers to planning, development, and operation of information systems and business processes as a whole, assuming open data for public data.

[4]: However, for security reasons, measures such as requiring users to register in advance or restricting access to data may be taken.

[5]: "Machine-readable" refers to the ability of computer programs to automatically process and edit data.

[6]: Although not considered open data, there are cases where the cost of maintaining and managing data provision systems is covered by charging fees from limited users.

[^7]: In the future, data created for administrative purposes should be maintained and ensured to be released as open data based on this guideline. The Cabinet Secretariat's IT Strategy Office is required to understand the maintenance status of each ministry and agency and make necessary adjustments.

[^8]: If it is not possible to release data as open data due to laws or reasonable grounds (including cases with restrictions on secondary use), this should be specifically indicated.

[^9]: If disclosing the reason for not being able to release is equivalent to disclosing the information that cannot be disclosed (non-disclosure information), it is permissible not to disclose the reason.

[^10]: Each ministry and agency (including facilities, local branch offices, and organizations belonging to ministries and agencies) broadly includes websites, database sites, and individual business sites established under their names.

[^11]: Rules regarding the use of each ministry and agency website, which are presented as a unified template from the perspective of promoting the secondary use of data published on government agency websites. Annex 1 of the "Basic Guidelines for the Disclosure of Ministry and Agency Data for the Promotion of Secondary Use" includes the "Government Standard Terms of Use (Version 2.0)".

[^12]: For example, statistical data published by each ministry and agency.

[^13]: Data that needs to be updated at regular intervals, such as event information, congestion rates of public transportation, or disaster and emergency information.

[^14]: Information that indicates what kind of data is being released. For example, property information such as title, publishing organization name, and creator (department name), as well as keywords for data search. For more details on other items, refer to the "Information on Metadata Provided on the Data Catalog Site" in the Data.go.jp "Information for Developers" (https://www.data.go.jp/for-developer/for-developer).

[^15]: Refer to the "Creative Commons Legal Code" for the definition of "CC0 1.0 Universal" (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).

[^16]: There are several stages to determine the "degree suitable for machine reading" based on how much computer can reuse the data without requiring manual intervention. For the computer to automatically reuse the data, it needs to be able to identify (read) the logical structure of the data and process the values (numeric values, text, etc.) within the structure.

[^17]: Refer to "Basic Concepts (Guidelines) for the Promotion of Government Data Publication for Secondary Use" section 3 "Concepts for expanding publication using data formats suitable for machine reading" and Annex 2 "Points to consider when creating data for numerical (table), textual, and geospatial information."

[^18]: According to the five-stage indicator proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the Web, if a file format meets the criteria for a license that allows secondary use regardless of the format, it is considered stage 1. The relatively high machine readability of the CSV format is considered stage 3. (http://5stardata.info/en/)

[^19]: Information that can be represented in matrices or hierarchies, such as statistical data.

[^20]: Formats that can be used universally, not limited to specific functions (CSV, XML).

[^21]: When publishing data containing tables in CSV format, refer to "Guidelines for Open Data Version 2.1" section 8.3.2 "Guidelines for tabular data." (http://www.vled.or.jp/results/OpenDataGuide_v21_fix.pdf)

[^22]: Information that is already publicly available, including information published in response to user requests, including those in paper format, is not included. However, the concept and operation of limited publication data (establishing a system to understand and evaluate the decision process and progress of limited publication) will be further examined as necessary.

[^23]: For example, it is possible to consider making some data paid while keeping the rest of the data free of charge.

[^24]: In order to create such a list, each government ministry and agency will take an inventory of the data they possess by the end of fiscal year 2017, and then attempt to hold roundtable discussions with the public and private sectors (including businesses, researchers, and citizens) to discuss the publication and utilization of data in high-demand fields. The roundtable discussions will cover the publication and utilization of both public and private sector data, including data held by local governments and businesses (including independent administrative agencies).

[^25]: In the document titled "Approach to Promoting Open Science in Our Country" (March 30, 2015), it is stated that research papers and research data as evidence for those papers, funded by public research funds, should be made publicly available as a general rule. It is also desirable to make research data as other research and development outcomes publicly available to the extent possible.
